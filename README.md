# Twitch.tv-mIRC-bot
A simple mIRC bot created for use with twitch.tv
Free for use all I ask is give credit where credit is due.
All sections are kept seperately on purpose so users can pick and choose what they want added to their own personal bot.
Just seems better than forcing things together and then there are unwanted functions included for those who dont know
how to seperate them.
